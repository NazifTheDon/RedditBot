10-10-22 SPY/ ES futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis;wallstreetbets;DaddyDersch;"Spy closing its 4th red day in a row today, however managing to hold the 52 week low. With the VIX quite elevated today I think its safe to say market is becoming more on edge about the CPI print on Thursday.

I had mentioned two important things last week that I wanted to watch. The red sideways channel from 362.8 to 378.2 and the red diamond support line at 362.8 Well we officially broke through both of those and now have a full candle closed below the daily 8ema. I think its fairly safe to say that markets are starting to realize once again the fed is not going to pivot and CPI is about to be a huge miss. 

361 looked like up until the last minute or so that it was going to hold. However with a failure to break a new LOY and that pretty impressive rally out of the 357s I am seeing some upside potential for tomorrow at least. With a hanging man candle closure on the daily we should look for a reversal up. I am looking for 362.8 resistance to be retested tomorrow. If bulls can retake that we should be looking for 366.7 to 370.7 as a closure. 

Historically FOMC minutes opens red and closes relatively fall (Wednesday) so from there we should see a fairly flat week going into CPI somewhere around that 366 to 373 range. 

Key support- 357.1 -&gt; 352.4

Key resistance- 361 -&gt; 362.8 -&gt; 366.7 -&gt; 370.5

Futures showing the same breakdown as SPY today. Overall that doji candle closure after bouncing off key 3600 support should provide some upside relief tomorrow and possibly Wednesday before CPI. 

Key support- 3600 -&gt; 3545

Key resistance- 3650 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3745

Apple held its red sideways channel today and actually managed to close out a green day. With the same doji formed on apple along with holding key 140 support I expect a push for the gap fill of 147.54 before CPI on Thursday. 

If we lose 138.2 at any point I would be pretty comfortable in some puts for a bigger breakdown and a test of Apples 52week low. 

Today for most of the day Apple looked very strong but was constantly being held down by SPY. 

Key support- 140 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 141.3 -&gt; 142.5-&gt; 144

Despite Tesla closing its 4th red day in a row, and 7th out of the last 8 trading days red… I actually see a lot of strength in Tesla. I am seeing a nice 223 double bottom form on both the daily and weekly charts. Tesla with the doji I will be looking for that 8 day long red resistance line to be broken finally. That resistance lies at 221.3 tomorrow. Failure to break through that resistance would lead to downside and a bigger support test near 212.9.

I am bullish for tomorrow based on Apple and Tesla. I think we see a small relief bounce before CPI prints on Thursday. Key resistance of a break of the red channel lies at 240 on Wednesday. 

I also believe IF CPI does print badly that Tesla puts are going to be a great play. I believe looking at the weekly that tesla could see as low as 178 before next weeks earnings hit and likely boosts it back up. Of course a miss on tesla earnings and its gonna be really scary.

The VIX is very interesting to watch right now. Seemingly there was no major news that should have caused the vix to reach 34 today. However, once it did reach 34 we saw a pretty massive unwind of it there which saved SPY from a new 52week low.

I am curious if we are going to see the VIX sitting closer to 33 to 34 this time. The one thing that helps the VIX is that the FOMC minutes release the day before CPI and that should cause a nice unwinding of the VIX historically. 

However, I am seeing the “capitulation” setup happening before our eyes… As long as the VIX holds near 32-35 before market closes on Wednesday AND cpi is a huge miss we should see the VIX break 40+ on Thursday. 

Septembers CPI saw the VIX spike 15%... usually we see a 15-20% spike on the VIX, however, it often unwinds by EOD… if we want to see the VIX break 40 we need to be at atleast 33-35 at market close on Wednesday night. 

Why is the VIX over 40 important? Well once we see that that is usually the sign of capitulation. Most people say VIX 40-60 is true capitulation signs.

Since I wont be here EOW to post any TA on this I wanted to add my weekly chart and what I am looking at. I am looking at SPY to most likely hold somewhere from 360-370 by Wednesday at market close. Assuming that CPI is a miss (which if you read my CPI post you see I am expecting this) and we are going to see VIX 40+ by EOW and I believe SPY could see 338 EOW. That’s about a 9% drop from 370… If we get a CPI miss and don’t see 338 this week I believe we bounce near 328 to 335 the following week. 

10% challenge- 

Today was a pretty great day… most of the gains came form the opening hour. Again price action is horrible to trade and we are seeing positions go green and then immediately rip red. This still remains a scalpers paradise and remains a quick and frequent profit market. This is not the market to be greedy in.
