Options Wash Sale;wallstreetbets;VisitDazzling1326;"Questions about taxes for this year.

Let's say I started with $5000 in my portfolio. I made $3000 in a stock and realized that and no longer touched that stock (protfolio = $8000). Then, I bought options of Tesla worth the $8000 and sold at a loss of $4000 (-50%). Then, the next day I bought Tesla options again and gained $100 after selling. I then bought spy options for $4000 and sold for a loss of $2000. I then bought spy options again and sold for a loss of $1000, so my account now has $2100 from the initial $5000 deposit. I'm curious how capital gains/losses work in this case. Thanks!";https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxsgn4/options_wash_sale/
Is the Santa Rally over? 12-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis;wallstreetbets;DaddyDersch;"&amp;#x200B;

Saw this chart posted a few weeks ago that breaks down santa rallies and how the markets react… of course this is just a blip of the last 23 years and is not an exhaustive list… however, I would say the biggest thing to note here is that the average return in January when there is no santa rally is -4.38%. That is a pretty bloody January.

Tomorrow we get another jobs report… I took a quick look at the last 5 reports. Interestingly enough we are averaging a 0.25% open on JOB reporting mornings. Since the December FOMC meeting we have not opened green on a jobs data day and we are actually for those two openings averaging a -1.04% red open… 

Some food for thought.

I mentioned that diamond pattern overnight on SPY and Futures and that futures had broken through support which should have opened up the downside. Well we finally got the downside we were looking for all last week. 

This break down today is the first time SPY has closed below 378 since November 9th (the day before November CPI). This also after 8 trading days consolidating between 379.6 and 386.4 the first time we have closed outside of that consolidation area. We also were once again able to wick to and hard reject that daily 8ema. 

With us now losing 378 support should now be looking for a retest of support near 374 and an ultimate retest of 370.6. If we lose 370.6 then going into Friday and beginning of 2023 opens up a potential for a drop into the 350s/360s. However, if we can get a hard bounce at 370.6 and break back over 378 resistance then we still could be looking for a 390.1 retest. 

Despite how much bearish momentum we have on spy here I do worry as we have been bear trapped time and time again here over the last 2 trading weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same pattern here on futures which as I mentioned yesterday with that breakdown through the diamond support it should have opened up the downside flush. We did start that leg down today. We also finally closed a candle below that 3845 to 3920 consolidation period. We now are trading at that key pivot point of 3805. 

If we lose 3805 then next support is 3750 followed my 3675. 

However, 3805 could hold as a big support area for us here. If that support holds then we are going to look for a bigger pop up to retest previous support at 3845. If we can break through that level then we are eyeing once again 3875 and 3910.

Tesla the crazy sum betch did it! She put in a green day! 

This is the FIRST green day tesla has closed in over 9 trading days (8 red days in a row). This is the biggest close at 3.31% since November 30th which was a 7.67% green day. 

Taking a look at Tesla i had mentioned before that there is a clear trend of big red drop -&gt; consolidation (red or green) -&gt; big drop -&gt; consolidation.. etc. etc… 

Being that today was not only a gravestone doji but also an inside day… we could actually be looking at a nice setup for a push back down tomorrow. 

Looking at this tight red bear channel 117.8 is the resistance for that level. And also yesterdays daily candle resistance level. IF we get another big push up on Tesla that could result in a bigger push down. 

Key support is 108.9 -&gt; 103.2

Key resistance is 112.7 -&gt; 117.8

Here is another fun little chart on Tesla… Since September 21st… if we look at all the days it closed &gt;-4% you can see there is actually a 60% chance that the next day it opens green… the average green open is 0.55%... This could net a nice 10-20% win on Tesla calls… now mind you these most likely need to be closed immediately at open though as it usually dumps hard… 

Interestingly enough though… since September 21st 100% of the time that it has closed greater than -7% down it has opened green the next day…. With an average green open of 1.63%. 

Some more food for thought…

Taking a look at the VIX I mentioned how I felt it has been suppressed and despite every effort to breakout is struggling. Well we actually had a really nice breakout triangle formed on the VIX. It managed to hold support and breakout through the daily 8 and daily 20ema. This too was a bullish engulfing candle. 

Now the question is what will the VIX do next… today was one of the first days we didn’t see a huge green open on the VIX in a while.. and that actually led to a pretty big drop intraday. The VIX also held its peak going into the end of the day too which has not been the common theme lately. 

23.6 is the key breakout level and also the key bear channel resistance level for tomorrow.

Today actually was a pretty great trading day. Had a really nice swing put win on SPY and then played some nice intraday puts and l2l plays. I actually didn’t trade much after noon today. The issue was that we were so close to that 378 support area that the risk to reward of a huge bounce which we did get was there. However, despite the fact that VOLD fully support that massive run up we had at noon to 1pm I did not believe in the rally and was waiting for the classic 123 rollercoaster down.

However, the issue for me was that after that big pop the technical were just not there to support any more puts for me at least and by time we finally got to a level where they were supported it was power hour which I am not a huge fan of trading. 

One interesting thing to note from todays power hour though is that this is the first sell off during power hour (sustained sell off) that we have had since December 9th. 

I do wonder with this support breaking and closing below and all these mornings of decently green pre markets fading into open if we are finally about to start our next leg down.";https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/
The Return of Blackberry (BB) - $15.92+/share (2024);wallstreetbets;SwankBerry;"I believe there is a lot of potential in Blackberry (BB).  I'm not a WSBer, but all the investing subs have blocked my posts because BB was caught up in the meme stocks, so WSB is the only place left.  This post focuses on a new product called **Blackberry Ivy**, launched in partnership with Amazon AWS.

If you haven’t been following BB, they no longer make phones and have transitioned to software. Their two main plays are cybersecurity and IoT, with a specific focus on QNX, a real-time operating system currently installed in 215M+ vehicles on the road.  While cybersecurity has been disappointing, QNX has been steady and shows promise.  QNX is used by 24 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers (only missing Tesla) and medical/industrial equipment.  You will see articles saying QNX is being ditched for Android Automotive, but this is just for infotainment.  QNX is still in these cars for safety-critical systems and runs below Android Automotive.  To use a crude analogy, Android Automotive is like Chrome and QNX is Windows.  However, this post is on a new product, called **Blackberry Ivy**, which has no known competitor and is first-to-market.

**What is Blackberry Ivy?**

Ivy is an auto software product that processes and standardizes sensor data both in the car and in the cloud. It allows for applications do be built more efficiently in cars and, in my opinion, will transform the auto apps market just like Apple app store or Android/Google Play did to phone apps.

To give just one example of what Ivy could do, imagine being a third-party app developer who wants to build an app for the auto market that recognizes when a vehicle occupant has fallen asleep, so the vehicle environment can be adjusted for a more enjoyable ride (e.g. The app would turn off air conditioning near that person, turn off volume from closest speaker, etc.). The way to determine if an occupant has fallen asleep is by using data from an inward-facing camera.  However, the auto manufacturer would never grant access to raw camera data to a third-party app developer. This is where Ivy comes in. Ivy standardizes the outputs, so you do not need the raw data. The data from the camera is sent to Ivy, where it is processed to standard outputs  (e.g. Driver = awake, Front-Passenger = awake, Rear-Right-Passenger =  asleep, etc.). The app uses these standardized outputs to create some action in the vehicle without ever seeing the actual video feed.

An app created with Ivy can then be used with any auto manufacturer using Ivy software, creating a  much larger app market.  A developer no longer has to make separate apps for Ford and BMW vehicles systems, he can just build his app with Ivy and that will work on any car using Ivy.  (Think how cell phones used to each create their own apps, until Android allowed them to share a common marketplace).  This is especially important for niche apps that already struggle to find a market.

The previous example is just a single example. There are numerous use-cases that can be described for vehicle payment systems, insurance, car maintenance, etc. with many of these already in the works. There is also tremendous potential for a consumer-focused or novelty app marketplace.  For example, Spotify could make a feature in their app that identifies the occupants and their music preferences, so the vehicle only plays songs that the most number of occupants would enjoy. That way someone who loves country music will not have to suffer through a rap playlist (e.g. In-ward facing camera sends video data to Ivy, Ivy outputs: Occupant ID: 30432493, Occupant ID: 34824492 are sent to the Spotify app, which uses an algorithm to cross-reference these IDs with playlists and finds songs both occupants would enjoy.  Spotify never has to see the raw camera data, yet it gives them a great feature for their app.  The car manufacturer benefits because they can create a better driving experience without having to spend a lot of money developing niche apps). This, of course, assumes some level of permission has been given by the occupants to be identified.

**What is Blackberry Ivy worth in revenue?**

BB's SAM estimate of $800M for Ivy in 2024 suggests Ivy could be worth up to $36.36/car/year (based on \~20M QNX vehicles and \~2M Tesla vehicles being produced in 2024).  I encourage you to do your own calculation.  Let's say Ivy is worth $10/car/year (with BB getting a 50% cut for $5/car/year).  Multiply $5/car/year by how many cars you think may adopt Ivy and be on the road for any given year (remember, BB QNX is currently installed into \~20M new cars each year, with the EV market set to grow).

If all 215M+ cars that currently run on QNX had Ivy, that would produce $1B in revenue each year.  I  believe Ivy will eventually bring in $1B/year for BB, the question is will it take 5 year or 10 years to get there.  Keep in mind, BB’s total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M, so this  would be a significant jump in revenue.

BB's SAM disclosure for Ivy can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): [https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700)

**What would this do to the stock price?**

BB would now be valued more like a high growth stock. BB currently has a P/S ratio of 3.1. High growth stocks like Crowdstrike (11.6), Cloudflare (16.4), Datadog (15.0), and ZScaler (12.7) all have much higher P/S ratios. If BB were to be valued similar to these companies (e.g. P/S ratio of 15) that would put the stock price at $15.92/share just for 2024. **This target stock price does not take into account any future revenue from Ivy, only BB being valued more like a growth stock based on current revenue.**

**Will Blackberry Ivy actually be adopted by auto manufacturers?**

There have been a number of recent indicators suggesting Ivy will be adopted by auto manufacturers.   Ivy is a 50/50 partnership with Amazon, but it is only in the last couple of months that Amazon AWS engineers have become more vocal about Ivy.  Sure, Amazon is involved in many ventures, but this seems different.  Ivy was featured a number of times at Amazon's re:Invent 2022 conference just a few weeks ago.  Amazon's general manager of automotive name-dropped Blackberry Ivy during a  presentation and that presentation had two other speakers: a senior vice president from Stellantis, who spoke about how Stellantis (which owns  Dodge/Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep/Opel/Peugeot/Ram/Vauxhall) is transitioning to a software-defined vehicle, and Amazon's general manager of automotive   technology, who discussed BB's QNX operating system and how Amazon was bringing it to the cloud.  Here is the presentation (Ivy name-drop after 13:00): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI)

The inclusion of Stellantis in a presentation discussing BB Ivy and BB QNX is notable.  When the first live demo of Ivy was presented at Bosch ConnectedWorld 2022 in November, the vehicle used in the demo was a Peugeot, a brand owned by Stellantis (Bosch, a leading supplier for automotive, is also partnering with Ivy).  At the earnings call last week, BB announced they will be demoing Ivy at CES 2023 in a Jeep Cherokee, another brand owned by Stellantis.

[Ivy live demo at Bosch ConnectedWorld in November](https://preview.redd.it/ldum9emvwn8a1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=519417edfdb6e37f082ad1f47fafde651d810e44)

BB announced they hope to have the first design win for Ivy by CES on Jan 5-8 and I expect Stellantis will be the first manufacturer to sign-on to Ivy (If it's not announced at CES, the next bet would be the earnings call in March).  Stellantis' CEO will also deliver a keynote at CES.

Re:Invent also featured another presentation on Blackberry Ivy being run by representatives from Amazon and Bosch.  That presentation was shared by two BMW engineers discussing machine learning.  One of Ivy's selling points is to better allow for machine learning models to be applied to   the data generated by the car sensors.  BMW also recently signed deals with Amazon AWS and already uses BB QNX.  Here is the presentation:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E)

It's an interesting coincidence that Stellantis and BMW are in presentations that discuss/mention BB Ivy, as well as doing public demos in Stellantis vehicles.

The AWS/Bosch presentation on Ivy had a very interesting slide showing companies that are already partnering with Ivy and showing some potential use-cases for Ivy:

Notice TomTom is mentioned for location-based services.  TomTom recently announced a collaboration with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft to create a new open map data system known as Overture Maps Foundation to counter Google Maps' dominance.  Does TomTom plan to send their own version of a Google Street View car around the world?  No.  It appears that TomTom plans to leverage the data already being collected by software-defined vehicles on the road.  How can TomTom use data from different auto manufacturers, each with their own systems?  Ivy standardizes it.  TomTom can then use the improved maps to service consumers.  Auto manufacturers bring in additional revenue selling the data collected from the vehicles and consumers get greatly improved mapping services.  Everyone wins.  And it is Ivy that facilitates this.  (Credit to [u/snoutandtruffle](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoutandtruffle/) for bringing TomTom to my attention.  I recommend reading every one of his posts about Ivy as he is the best at spotting new info, IMHO).

Blackberry Ivy is also agnostic, meaning manufacturers don't have to use Amazon AWS cloud or BB QNX in order to use Ivy.  This gives them complete control over the data.

**Final Thoughts:**

I'm not here to pump and dump a stock.  I'm also not claiming BB will become a $1T company.  But, I believe BB will be successful and will become many times more valuable than it is now.  Time will tell.  Keep an eye on BB.  Set reminders for Jan 9 and Mar 31 and see if any auto manufacturers have signed-on to Ivy.  If they have (especially if Stellantis is named), come back to this post with a new set of eyes.

I am long BB with a price average below $10 CAD.  I have held for 4 or 5 years (pre-meme).  A merry Christmas to you and your families.";https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxdf4g/the_return_of_blackberry_bb_1592share_2024/

Do not over-idolize anyone...;wallstreetbets;kayn1k;"Some of the bagholders will not like reading this, but Elon hype is dead, it's over. I am sorry but this is it. You know how stockmarket works, once a hype is gone it's gone. Nobody will ever believe him again. Even if he goes to Mars now, or sends 100 tesla to the orbit, doesn't matter. He will be remembered as doge scammer, pump &amp; dumper, liar etc. his ego has taken over his identity and morality.

Look, majority of humans have this weakness that when large amounts of money enter their life, they lose their minds. They become arrogant, power-hungry, lose humility, their very identity and morality. They start to play mini-God and surround themselves with yes-man, and if their mini-God status ever gets challenged, they go mad and not shy away to use illegal ways that they did not use at the beginning of their story.

Just look around you. I am sure you have a couple friends who become rich from a lucky hit on stockmarket, family inheritence or through early bitcoin or some other way. I am not exaggerating, 99% of the time you will see same story happening. The guy that was your best friend years ago that you could argue any subject no longer tolerates to hear you oppose them anymore. He has more money so in his mind he is more ""successful"" so that makes him ""right"" on everything. He no longer seeks friends who tell the truth to their face, he seeks people who admires his supreme intelligence and supreme decisions.

I admired Elon Musk when he had Mars landing presentations etc. people believed he is the new kid on the block with crazy ideas for humanity's progression. I admired Bill Gates before he became the vaccine lord and started to dictate how people should live their lives. I was a Binance user for a long time and I admired CZ. CZ is no longer same person as first time Binance was launched. He has a very similar story like many others that started humble and promising, only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator.

Bottom line is that: Do not over-idolize anyone, not Warren Buffet, not Vitalik etc. anyone I mean anyone regardless of how genius or humble they seem today. Very very few people don't lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life, and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground. But at the end everyone is just human and prone to same weaknesses. That is why history keeps repeating itself over and over again.

If by chance that you do get rich one day from this capitalism's game of stonks remember where it started and remember who was with you when you had nothing. Having some self principles and self virtues will keep your ego in check and keep your feet on the ground.";https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zwy3r1/do_not_overidolize_anyone/
12-27-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis;wallstreetbets;DaddyDersch;"I hope everyone had a great Christmas! SPY welcomed us today with the red and green. Another excruciatingly boring day after the first hour. A total lack of volume, follow through and overall technical support to moves. 

I saw this chart posted the other day and thought it was very interesting. I plan to at the EOY probably over new years 3 day weekend do a 2023 projection for big tech and SPY with where we possibly could go. But this chart shows that despite Tesla seemingly being the “easy” short that Apple, Msft and Google (maybe Adobe) are the best shorts.

Here we have the prices as of today 12/27 of optimized extreme bear plays for June 2023 for those above tickers. I plan to reference back to these throughout the year. I want to wait personally until the week of January 9th to open any long plays. For me I still believe that Apple, Msft, and Google are the best play. However, I honestly worry about how strong MSFT is and that it could actually hold up the best in a long drawdown.   
 

If I had to pick right now I would get SPY, Apple, Google and maybe Amazon puts. Netflix, adbe, nvidia are just too price already. And despite the probable Tesla downfall I wouldn’t buy it without some sort of 20-30% relief bounce first.

Well SPY continues to be hella frustrating… Last week I mentioned with the daily 8ema rejection and break through 378 we should have and were setting up to see a bigger push down to 360-370. However, as you can see put in some really strong support at that 379.6 area and we have not been able to break that down. With that big bounce and breakout with bullish engulfing candle on Friday one would have suspected we were going to see 386-390 today. Even looking at futures overnight which were up 0.7% at one point one would have suspected a bigger move up today. 

However, we found that 383 actually was a very strong resistance area that we couldn’t quite break through. Taking a look at this chart we have a generalized range of 379.6 to 386.3. however, when we look at the last 5 trading days besides December 21st we actually have a tighter range of 383 to 379.6. Todays hanging man candle actually formed a nice triple top at 383 too. Depending on the structure of tomorrows candle we could also turn this into a evening doji star pattern (bearish pattern). 

I have referenced my favorite diamond pattern many times before. This is about as tight of a diamond pattern as we could get (futes has it too). The way I see it that we either open over the blue support line of 382.2 (+0.2%) or we open under the red resistance line of 380.4 (-0.3%). I expect tomorrow to (and overnight) to establish the next 2-3 day move on SPY. 

If we break the blue support line then we are likely to see 378 retested and if that fails im looking at 370.6 by EOW Friday. 

If we breakout through the red resistance line (and more importantly the daily 8ema) then I will be eyeing a 386 to 390 retest by EOW.

Taking a look at Futures we are in the exact same pattern as SPY daily. This nice big diamond pattern here. With this opening of the futures daily candle we have officially broken the support of the diamond pattern. Key resistance of this pattern is 3872.  

I am eyeing next key consolidation level of 3845. We have bounced off this 3840 to 3850 support area 6 times in a row now. It is a very strong support area. If we lose that support its going to signal a pretty strong downturn. 3805 is the next major support. 

Resistance is at 3880 and 3920.

Tesla is just full on capitulating at this point. I cant believe that it dropped almost 12% intraday today. 

Tesla has dropped 45.6% in 17 trading days… Absolutely impressive.

With tesla losing 111.4 weekly support. Next major levels I have are 94.4 and 60.7. Full on death to tesla is 27.8 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by January 2024.

I really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that I could trust entering some puts on it. I just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last  month were free money on tesla… buy a put at these levels. But I also think buying a call is straight wasting money. I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation.

The VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. 

There are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. 

Market wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow.

I felt like today reminded me a lot of Friday in that we had absolutely no sense of direction and no continuation. This morning the theta on premiums even my 7-8dte was aggressive too. Tough day to trade but was able to get in and out of some plays quickly and play some nice l2l. Overall not a great day but a green day at least.";https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zwtho8/122722_spy_es_futures_and_tesla_daily_market/
