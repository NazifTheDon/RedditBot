Amazon lost half its value this year as tech stocks got crushed and recession fears grew,wallstreetbets,predictany007,"It was a brutal year for mega-cap tech stocks across the board. But 2022 was especially rough for Amazon.

Shares of the e-retailer are wrapping up their worst year since the dot-com crash. The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.

Amazon’s market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.

Much of Amazon’s misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.

But Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn’t pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon’s stock to record highs as sales soared.

As the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon’s impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand. It’s since paused or abandoned plans to open some new facilities, and its head count shrank in the second quarter.

Amazon (AMZN) is set to close its worst year since 2000 and second worst on record as the stock is currently down 51% YTD, lost half of its value this year due to fears on recession. How much further do you think AMZN will fall next year?"
So Santa Rally is back on? Maybe?... 12-29-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,wallstreetbets,DaddyDersch,"Well that might have been the absolute WORST “trend” day that I have ever seen. I think this is the longest and tightest range I have ever seen SPY trade within. From 1145 until EOD every candle closed within a 50 cent range of eachother. 

Total movement wise was $1.2 of total movement from peak to trough over 4.25 hours of trading. Absolutely brutal.

Tomorrow is the Quarterly options expiration and is also when we will finally see the JPM collar rotated. 

A little interesting data about the quarterly expiration day… this is the first (presumably unless we have a wild -12% day haha) on SPY that we have closed closer to the Calls then the puts. We actually here at market close are sitting $2 from the 3870 calls. (note- originally the JPM collar was at 3870) but it appears looking at the OI for tomorrow the call are actually at 3835 with 60k of calls…. 3400P with 42.6k and 2860P with 41.8k)

But if we look at the trends here of the last 4 quarterly options expiration there is actually not a single quarterly in the last four that has opened green… the last 4 quarterlies have opened red and averaged a -1% open. 

Also interesting to note is that the first trading day after quarterly has opened green 3 out of 4 times averaging a 0.58% green open. 

A few things to note about the quarterly days too is that most besides the June quarterly have closed lower than its opening price… remember June was when we were sitting between the put strikes too. 

September 30th- 1.6% rally at open followed by a 2.4% total drop from 115am till EOD. 1% total drop during the last 30 minutes of trading.

June 30th- 1.2% drop at open -&gt; 2.2% rally till 1pm -&gt; 1.45 drop from 1pm till 330pm -&gt; 0.9% drop last 30 minutes. 

March 31st- 0.5% rally until 1030 -&gt; 1.7% drop from 1030 until EOD -&gt; 1.34% drop during the last 30 minutes. 

That means we are averaging about a 1.1% rally from the morning low to the HOD. After that we are averaging a 2.1% drop into the EOD and the last 30 minutes of trading is averaging a 0.98% drop by itself. 

The one caveat here would be that this is the first time we have closed the day before over the call side of the collar. In theory I would think all that call OI coming off the books would lead to a bigger drop through the day. But this is going to be a new trend to watch for sure tomorrow. The last two months have showed us what has worked before is not always going to work in this market.

Something interesting to note is that over night the CBOE equities put/ call ratio had a massive (record breaking) spike in the put call ratio… it hit 2.4 which is apparently a record for it. The last time this happened was on December 21st which also was a record breaking spike for it. 

If you remember December 21st was very similar in that we were in a very big breakdown pattern and had clear momentum to break through 378, however, we had a huge spike that very next day in the CBOE equities put call ratio and that resulted in a huge gap up and a big 1.5% green day… The very nice day SPY put in a red -1.43% day, however, at one point was down over 3%. That was the day where we had some extreme bear momentum and had touched 375 area and had an impressive EOD rally to close back in that 380 area. A 2-3% red close would put us near 371-375.

With what I mentioned above about the quarterly trend AND what happened last time we had a huge spike in CBOE put call ratios… it is very possible we COULD see a breakdown tomorrow. EOD and really after 1145am today showed a lot of weakness in SPY and we could not break through that wall at 383.9.

 Taking a loo k at the SPY daily here. You can see that the blue bear channel we were trading in has now been broken and we are actually establishing a red support line. With that break down and closure under 378 yesterday that should have caused a continuation down, however, the buy pressure and volume today was absolutely insane. Not quite sure where all the buy pressure came from. 

So now taking a look at the daily it appears we are actually trading back inside of that 379.6 to 386.4 consolidation range. There actually really is a tighter 383.5 to 379.6 range that has no over the last 8 trading days only had 2 candles close outside of it. 

With spy closing over its daily 8ema for the first time since December 14th this should provide some upside. I would personally like to see us close over 386.6 minimally before I expect any bigger push. However, if we happened to get a huge green day (1.8%) and closed over 390.1 then I would feel even more confident in a push to the 400s next week and we actually COULD see a “santa rally.”

Its not perfect… but there actually is a nice inverted head and shoulder forming here on the zoomed out daily chart on spy… IF this plays out correctly then that really could be a huge push for us to 410-420 area. 



https://preview.redd.it/02hfgnd4vw8a1.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a185beaea0de0fb9a653e4d6f3cd4c8d1a89c823

Keeping that in mind we actually could see a “short peak” put in near 390 before we see our next leg down. Trend wise this year we have seen a short peak put in BEFORE we get the next leg down. The last two weekly candles (if we closed here) are also reversal dojis which do provide upside for next week. 

Key support- 379.6 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 376.6

Key resistance- 386.3 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 390.2

Futures shows that consolidation channel a little better. I did mention overnight we could get that 3805 double bottom and that would be the bulls last defense. They took it seriously and gave us a massive bounce overnight with this daily candle not even fully touching 3805. 

Futures remain in a 3805 to 3920 consolidation channel. 3845 was previous support of that consolidation channel and there is a more major resistance line still at 3975 which we did fail to break over and close over today. On futures we actually did NOT close over the daily 8ema and actually saw a rejection at that 3870 level of the daily 8ema. 

An EOW closure under 3805 would make me bearish… and a closure over 3920 would make me bullish. 

Support- 3845 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3750

Resistance- 3870 -&gt; 3920

Tesla had a great day today. Actually tesla had a great two days in all reality.

Currently cycle wise we are at day 2 of the bounce and currently at 14.2%. now this was nearly double the drop and nearly double the previous average drop also… so we could be looking at a 4 day 28% pop… that would put tesla at the 136 to 139 range before it sees a rejection. 

This actually would get tesla back to its daily 20ema which is historically when it sees a rejection. 

Key support- 117.5 -&gt; 113 -&gt; 108.9

Key resistance- 126.4 -&gt; 135.9

The VIX is holding its support line. Despite that huge PC ratio on CBOE equities we did not get much of a VIX movement. We actually look very similar to December 21st which you can see the day AFTER that we had that massive 20% spike on the VIX. That 20% spike is what caused the huge 3% drop on SPY… expect we saw a huge intraday reversal that gave back 50%+ of the drop. 

As you can see we are in that bear channel but we are actually forming a nice breakout triangle here too… a drop under 21.6 tomorrow could confirm the upside move is coming that I mentioned. However, if we open and push green here that move might have to wait until next week. 

**Daily log-**

Not a great day for me here today. I played the overnight put swing however we obviously had that unexpected PC spike and had a huge green open. I was actually a little surprised at the puts having any value left in them at open. 

I played a potential reversal on SPY early in the morning that was clearly not a fake breakdown. I recognized early today the extreme bull momentum we had on SPY and how aggressively VOLD was pushing. However, I just couldn’t based on my indicators find an entry I liked or wanted to take. 

Days like today are very very tough to play. When you have rules to enter a trade and those rules never show an entry but had you broken your rules and just “taken it anyways” you woulda taken a win is hard to digest. However, if 2022 bear market has taught me anything… its that we NEVER break out rules for one or two trading days that are the exception. 

Really outside of my swing play that was a loss today was just a small red day. The red swing makes it feel worse than it was. 

For me and I have said this all of 2022… we need to be picky on the trades we make and we need to be preserving capital for whenever we return to a “normal” market… I don’t mean a bull market I mean a normal market. 2022 has been anything but normal and honestly… 2023 does not look much better at all… 

Tomorrow is the last trading day of the year… lets make it a good one!"
