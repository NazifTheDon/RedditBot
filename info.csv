$TSLA trade plan to $1Million;wallstreetbets;CustomerWeak1805;"I got alot of cash right now and im gonna buy 1k shares of tesla in the next weeks, got some orders on some resistance points. Im pretty sure tesla will reach 600$ next year just by fundamentals alone. Right now tesla is so freaking cheap i cant really believe it. My estimation is tesla will probably do around 10$ eps next year, with a multiple of 50 thats a 500$ stock. If growth trajectory is still 50% by then teslas pe needs to be higher so with a pe of 80(like now) that would be a 800$ stock. I believe the risk reward is pretty high here and im going for it. 
What are ur thoughts guys?";https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1k7r5/tsla_trade_plan_to_1million/
10-11-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis;wallstreetbets;DaddyDersch;"Just like that all the bullish momentum that SPY and markets gathered off the 356/357 support area was quickly washed away thanks to the BOE. Last week the BOE saved the markets this week they killed them. However, the markets STILL are not ready for the big one yet… VIX still failing to hold over 34 and markets despite another 52 week low are holding for now.

The way I see it we just closed our 5th red day in a row. The VIX is magneted to 34 and cant quite break over it but cant quite hold under 33. Once CPI drops on Thursday we are either 1. About to start the 10-20% capitulation move JPM is calling for with VIX hitting 45-50 by next week and we see markets hit 300-320… OR 2. CPI beats and takes all the tensions and fear out of the markets and we watch VIX break under 30 and SPY pushes back for 400+.

Current black bear channel shows Thursday SPY can either hit 338 support (also the 2022 bear market support) or 370+. My vote remains 338 Thursday (depending on where spy closes tomorrow). 

This 4 day long red resistance line remains key in preventing us from breaking out. 357.3 remains resistance tomorrow.

Historically FOMC minute days are a red open followed by a smaller 0.5 +/- close. Occasionally we do close 1% though. Tomorrow FOMC minutes at 2pm will be interesting though because with how on edge markets are this could very well tip us over the edge. However, a good FOMC minutes where there isn’t too hawkish of news we haven’t heard of we could see a small relief rally. 

I would have liked to seen a green close today (and we were on path for it till the BOE news). I am bearish for this CPI believing that CORE is going to miss. However, I do not like the idea of buying puts after 6 red days in a row on SPY (assuming tomorrow is red too). 

Now of course we did just have September 20th to September 27th close 6 red days in a row so its not unexpected to see 6 red days and even a 7th if the news warrants it.

Futures managed to hold that 3600 support line again today. Key support tomorrow is 3600 and key resistance is 3612. Tight levels but if futures can get through 3612 we just might see a green breakout day. However if we break through that 3600 level too much and start breaking under 3579 we might flush into CPI.

Surprisingly Apple held the red channel its been in for 2 weeks now. Key support remains 138.2 and key resistance remains at 139.6. Apple still has a gap to fill up at 145.22. 

If we see Apple break through and close under 138.1 tomorrow even if CPI beats we could end up seeing a bigger break down next week on Apple. Tech looked very heavy today.

Tesla continues to get absolutely crushed. It looked the strongest this morning with SPY was drilling and when apple was too. However, one SPY and Apple found support it seemed like Tesla had wasted all its momentum. We didn’t quite see that 213 support test today, however we did break the red resistance line that is 9 days old. This should provide some short term upward bull momentum for Tesla assuming Apple can hold support and SPY can breakout holding that 356 support. I would be surprised to see Tesla retest resistance 223 to 233.

Tesla remains to be the most volatile. I can see a case where if CPI breaks us down that Tesla could see 180s. However, with Tesla being so overdue for a bounce if CPI beats and markets rally we might finally see Tesla get back to the 250+ area.

The VIX is telling us that the market is about unedge as it can be. With VIX refusing to break that support line today we are going to be looking at support of 34 tomorrow and possibly a high of 34.7 to 36.4 if FOMC minutes spikes the vix like usual. 

There is a chance we could see the VIX push up and that there is no relief with FOMC minutes… this is setting the VIX up for 40+ CPI… with the normal CPI being 15-20% we could see the VIX break 40 on Thursday if the VIX closes over 32-34. 

As I was saying I think we are setting up for a bigger dump on SPY. However, this has happened with previous CPIs too. However, this is about the most tense I have seen the markets. 

The most recent time I think the markets/ VIX have been this close to capitulation was May when the May 11th CPI hit the markets. We were looking for a CPI of 8.1 but got an actual CPI of 8.3. The VIX closed at 32.98 the day before CPI hit the markets. However, it opened at 32.87 reaching a max of 34.39 and a LOD of 30.69. SPY was also at the time sitting at its 52week low and on a massive drop leading up to it. 

So now why did SPY now dump through the abyss and why did the VIX not break over 40? Well its simple CORE CPI decrease from Aprils 6.2 to Mays 6.0. So at the time it appeared inflation was getting better. Also we obviously were in a much different time period, economic state, etc. etc. back then. 

So as I have been saying…. What is it going to take to put SPY in the 330s, VIX over 40 and send the markets crashing? (doing a bit of a CPI update/ play here since I will be gone tomorrow till next week and wont be able to update a post).

Well if my math is correct and the historical trend of 0.2% +/- from consensus/ Cleveland fed holds true… then best case scenario is 

CPI 7.9%, CPI CORE 6.3%, CPI MoM 0% per the consensus. 

CPI 8%, CPI CORE 6.4-6.5%, CPI MoM 0.1% per the Cleveland fed

And worst case scenario is 

CPI 8.3%, CPI CORE 6.7%, CPI MoM 0.4% per the consensus 

CPI 8.4%, CPI CORE 6.8%, CPI MoM 0.5% per the consensus

So as you can see we have in my opinion MAYBE one bullish scenario… and that is that CPI, CORE CPI, and CPI MoM all beat consensus by the standard deviation of 0.2%. However, if you look at CORE last month it was 8.3%. Is no change in CPI CORE enough to take the fear out of the markets? Personally I don’t think it is… CORE needs to come down especially after spending most of May to last month steady unchanged. And of course if the consensus/ Cleveland fed misses by the 0.2% then well brace for impact. 

Note- there was one time this year in February where there was a 0.3% variance. However most variances are a MAX 0.2%. Of course we have seen plenty of 0-0.1% variances which would all be bearish scenarios. 

With the BOE new hitting the wires today, CPI looming things could get really interesting here. 

10% challenge-

This has been a killer two days for me. I will not be trading the rest of the week (besides CPI play and maybe some longs after CPI). But I am going into a 3 day vaca with a 17 trade win streak and about $4600 in profits. Not too bad! Had a couple lottos I let run today which I don’t ever do. 

Note- I will NOT be trading Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. I will be away with family. Will check in briefly at times. I will post any trades or updates I see in the server for you guys. 

Note 2- there will be NO TA/ youtube posted Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. I will get a bigger Monday night update posted for you guys once im home and working. I will be trading full time starting Monday again. 

Tonights youtube video will be posted later tonight! 

Trade lightly these next 3 days with FOMC minutes and CPI with the VIX at 34 we are looking at some crazy volatility. We saw a massive $7 drop today like it was nothing. Anything can happen. Don’t over trade, trade smart, take profits whenever you can… five 3-5% wins is better then a 10% loss. Be aggressive but smart. Get in and get out. DO NOT BE GREEDY OR FOMO!
